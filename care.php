	<h2>Foot care; simple suggestions for healthier feet</h2>

	<p>A wise man once said to ensure that we always have a comfortable bed and comfortable footwear,
	because if we're not in one then we're in the other. You will have to get advice elsewhere regarding
	a bed, but comfortable footwear is very important for the wellbeing of our feet.</p>

	<p>Our feet swell a little as the day passes, so shopping for new shoes is best done in the afternoon.
	Try on a range of footwear and make sure that you stand up and walk around to see how comfortable and
	supportive they are. Very few of us have two feet the same size, so be sure to try both shoes on.
	Since shoes are sold in pairs of matched sizes, make sure that you buy the size that fits your biggest
	foot without pinching. Also remember that if our overall weight increases, then the increased load on
	our feet will make them spread further and lead to our existing footwear becoming tighter.</p>

	<p>If your budget will run to it, consider buying a pair of made-to-measure shoes. People who do usually
	extol the benefits and added comfort that they have brought to their feet. Additionally, although the
	initial cost is greater than that of stock footwear, it can be argued that there is often a longer-term
	payback in well-fitting shoes through a reduced need for foot health treatment.</p>
	
	<p>Ensure that you keep your feet clean, but avoid using strong soaps or very hot water when you wash them.
	Dry the skin carefully by patting rather than too vigorously with a hard towel. If your skin is dry
	apply lanolin or olive oil.</p>

	<p>Check your feet regularly for any injuries such as burns, cracks, cuts and bruises, particularly if you
	have existing health problems such as diabetes. In the event of injury seek immediate professional
	advice.</p>

	<p>Do not cut corns, calluses or ingrown toenails, but seek suitable professional advice and treatment.
	Avoid exposing your feet to prolonged cold and dampness.</p>

	<p>Avoid using harsh or strong medications or chemical compounds for foot conditions, such as corn cures,
	as these can often damage delicate foot tissue.</p>
	
	<p>Proper foot care and treatment will pay dividends by reducing pain and discomfort, and help your feet
	to carry on performing their function in supporting you to live a full and happy life.</p>
