	<h2>Making an appointment/contacting Feet Come First</h2>
	
	<p>I take the care of your feet very seriously, as I know how important good foot health is to our
	wellbeing. If you would like to chat about the mobile foot services that I provide, then I will
	be happy to talk this over with you. I would also be happy to talk about any specific foot problems
	or concerns that you may have.</p>

	<p>If you would like me to treat your feet, then the first appointment will include an assessment
	of your current foot health along with my recommendations for their care. I also work in partnership
	with and refer to primary care and hospital podiatry services to ensure that your feet problems
	receive the appropriate care and attention that they deserve.</p>

	<p>For more information, to discuss your current foot health, or to make an appointment at a time and
	venue to suit you, please contact me, Mike Shepherd, by one of the following ways:</p>
