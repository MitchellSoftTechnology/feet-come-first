<h2>Foot Facts</h2>

	<ul id="facts">
		<li>Leonardo Da Vinci called the human foot <em>"The greatest engineering device in the whole world"</em>
		and it is hard to argue with that. The average person walks about 10,000 steps each day, with each
		step having to bear around 2&#189; times our body weight. Across a lifetime this equates to travelling a
		distance of around 115,000 miles, or more than 4 times around the world. Small wonder then that our
		feet can give us problems without us giving them the necessary care and attention they deserve.
		Further on, I provide some useful suggestions for helping to minimise the chances of problems with
		our feet.</li>

		<li>The world's largest known feet belong to Matthew McGrory, a 7'4" resident of Florida whose size 27&#189;
		(UK size) feet require specially-made footwear costing around &#163;14,000.</li>

		<li>Our feet are made up of 52 bones, representing 25% of all our bones.</li>

		<li>Women suffer with around 4 times as many foot problems than men. This is largely due to women's
		choice of footwear - often narrow toes and higher heels. This is compounded by them walking an average
		of 3 miles further than men each day, coupled with their average height differential requiring more
		steps to cover the same distance.</li>

		<li>Our feet are home to around 250,000 sweat glands each, which can together excrete around half a
		pint of sweat in a day.</li>
